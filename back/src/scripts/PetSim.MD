### Egg System

Eggs are the primary method for obtaining pets. Players can find eggs randomly while playing or purchase them from shops.

#### Egg Types

### Pet Leveling System

When a player hatches a duplicate pet, instead of getting another copy, the existing pet gains a level (up to level 10).

#### Level Multipliers

| Level | Multiplier | Bonus Increase |
| ----- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1     | 1.0x       | Base           |
| 2     | 1.5x       | +50%           |
| 3     | 2.0x       | +100%          |
| 4     | 3.0x       | +200%          |
| 5     | 4.0x       | +300%          |
| 6     | 6.0x       | +500%          |
| 7     | 8.0x       | +700%          |
| 8     | 12.0x      | +1100%         |
| 9     | 18.0x      | +1700%         |
| 10    | 25.0x      | +2400%         |

When a pet reaches max level (10) and a player hatches another duplicate, they receive 500 bonus coins instead.

#### Pet Growth Mechanics

As pets level up, they also grow slightly in size:

- Each level increases pet size by 5% (growth factor of 0.05 per level)
- The formula is: `finalSize = baseSize * (1 + (level - 1) * 0.05)`
- Visual representation changes in real-time when levels increase

### Random Rewards System

While playing, players have a 15% chance to receive a bonus reward every time they collect coins by jumping.

#### Reward Types and Probabilities

| Reward Type | Amount      | Chance | Description              |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------ |

- Updates include changing the pet's text label to show its new level
- Size components are updated in real-time based on level

### Player Data Persistence

- Player data is stored in memory during the game session
- Includes coins, pets inventory, egg inventory, and other statistics
- Data is maintained until player disconnects
